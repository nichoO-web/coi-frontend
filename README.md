# COI - Circle Of Influence

COI is an application designed to allow companies(ideally in sales i.e. real estate, car sales, etc.) to keep track of their contacts across their entire staff. Employees can login and add contacts to the database, each containing their name, email, phone#, and occupation, as well as any additional details that might be useful depending on the contact. These contacts are also filtered by category, these being Resources, Team, Clients, or Hot Leads.
